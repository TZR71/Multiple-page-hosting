    <p>
      The domestication of the dog was the process which led to the domestic
      dog. This included the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its
      domestication, and the emergence of the first dogs. Genetic studies
      suggest that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and
      descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf population – or closely
      related wolf populations – which was distinct from the modern wolf
      lineage.[3][4] The dog's similarity to the grey wolf is the result of
      substantial dog-into-wolf gene flow,[3] with the modern grey wolf being
      the dog's nearest living relative.[5] An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may
      have been the ancestor of the dog.[5][1][6]
