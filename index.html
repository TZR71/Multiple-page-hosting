      <p>
        The domestication of the dog was the process which led to the domestic
        dog. This included the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its
        domestication, and the emergence of the first dogs. Genetic studies
        suggest that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and
        descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf population – or closely
        related wolf populations – which was distinct from the modern wolf
        lineage.[3][4] The dog's similarity to the grey wolf is the result of
        substantial dog-into-wolf gene flow,[3] with the modern grey wolf being
        the dog's nearest living relative.[5] An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf
        may have been the ancestor of the dog.[5][1][6]
